# Documentation of Components with Storybook

Welcome to the component documentation using Storybook! In this project, we use Storybook as a powerful tool to create a library of visually appealing and interactive components, making development, testing, and collaboration in our project easier.

## Overview

Storybook is a UI development platform that allows us to create, test, and document components in isolation. It helps us build and maintain reusable components, ensuring they function correctly and have a consistent appearance throughout the project.

The component documentation using Storybook includes:

1. **Visual Catalog**: An interactive interface that allows you to explore each component individually in different states and variations.
2. **Exemplary Code**: Clear and concise examples of how to use each component, including source code.
3. **Technical Details**: Information about the properties, methods, and events that each component accepts.
4. **Visual Testing**: Visual tests that ensure the visual stability of components over time.

## Access to Documentation

You can access the component documentation using the following link: [https://storybook.gastawny.com/](https://storybook.gastawny.com/)

## How to Use

1. **Navigation**: On the Storybook website, navigate through the sidebar to find the different available components.
2. **Interactive Preview**: Click on a component to view its variations, states, and interactions.
3. **Exemplary Code**: Copy the code snippets provided in the "Exemplary Code" section to use the components in your own project.
4. **Technical Details**: Refer to the "Technical Details" section for information about the properties and features of each component.
5. **Visual Testing**: Review the visual tests to ensure that the components maintain their appearance over time.
